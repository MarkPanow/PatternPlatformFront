            "Control rooms, as place[s] where an entity has control over a process" (cf. Hollnagel & Woods, 2005), are
            of particular importance to the safety and well-being of people in
            various walks of life and situations. Whether an ambulance is required, traffic needs to be regulated, or
            uninterrupted supplies of electricity, gas, and water are taken for granted, control centers represent
            critical infrastructures and their operators bear a great responsibility. While they have changed
            significantly over the last 30 years in terms of available information and communication technologies, the
            distribution of tasks between humans and machines, and the degree of automation, the user interfaces and
            interaction design are still characterized by application following the WIMP paradigm (Windows, Icons,
            Menus, Pointers)available on stationary devices with displays of different sizes.

            The main goals of this project are to develop design patterns for scalable interaction design in control
            rooms and to design an assistance system to be worn by operators. This will involve determining how wearable
            technologies can be used both to implement the design patterns and to (unobserved) evaluate their use in the
            field. As part of these studies, the cognitive load and affective state of operators will be modeled on a
            body-worn computer and used to influence the flow of information to users. This attentional model is used to
            appropriately represent alarms and other control room events. The wearable assistance system also assists
            users in logging processes/tasks by using sensors that detect manual actions. The resulting design patterns
            and their implementation using wearable assistants will be validated under realistic but reproducible
            conditions with control room personnel and evaluated for usability and user experience. The user experience
            research is oriented towards the question: Do control room operators perceive a wearable assistant based on
            design patterns as paternalism (in terms of autonomy and expertise) or support (in terms of safety)?
